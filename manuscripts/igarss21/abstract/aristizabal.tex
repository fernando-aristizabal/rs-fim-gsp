\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Floods represent one of the most significant natural disasters \cite{national_weather_service_2020,national_weather_service_2019,national_weather_service_2018,us_department_of_commerce_2020} with trends indicating that impacts will only continue to increase in the future \cite{mallakpour2015changing,downton2005reanalysis,kunkel1999temporal,pielke2000precipitation,corringham2019effect,tabari2020climate,milly2002increasing,wing2018estimates}. 
While the United States Geological Survey (USGS) operates a network of thousands stream gages across the United States, it still leaves considerable amount of data scarcity particularly along lower order streams as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:histogram_gages} which compares the distribution of stream orders for gaged and ungaged stream reaches within the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Version 2.
Having more and improved data via remote sensing related to river discharge, stage, and inundation extents could provide key stakeholders with more robust means of forecasting, preparing for, and responding to floods in data scare regions around the world.

A variety of satellite based sensors have been used in the detection of surface water including multi-spectral \cite{nigro2014nasa,sanyal2004application,wang2004using,brakenridge2006modis,jain2005delineation,nghiem2000flood,hussain2011mapping,frazier2000water,dewan2006flood,brivio2002integration}, microwave \cite{de2015global,schumann2015microwave,de2010flood,bindlish2008role,de2009global,kundu2015flood}, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) \cite{aristizabal2020high,shastry2019using,martinis2010automatic,kudahetty2012flood,schlaffer2015flood,chini2019sentinel,chaabani2018flood,huang2018automated,saatchi2019sar,kasischke2003effects,hess2003dual}.
While SAR does have its own inherent limitations such as terrain distortions and interference with vegetation and anthropogenic features, it boasts a significant number of strengths when compared to other sensors for detection of riverine surface water including high spatial resolution, self-illumination, and low atmospheric attenuation \cite{saatchi2019sar,muckenhuber2016open}.
To counter limitations associated with vegetative and anthropogenic interference, researchers have employed terrain information in the form of digital elevation models (DEM) and detrended DEMs \cite{townsend1998modeling,aristizabal2020high,shastry2019using,saatchi2019sar,twele2016sentinel,huang2017comparison}.
These methods fall short of providing

\section{Materials and Methods}
\label{sec:materials_and_methods}

The proposed procedure leverages a four step process to counter some of the limitations of SAR based flood inundation mapping (FIM) including errors of omission from vegetation and anthropogenic feature interference and errors of commission including anthropogenic features that cause specular reflections or multi-bounces such as roads or dense buildings.
The first step performs image segmentation on the SAR imagery parameterizing two modes within the data via unsupervised learning.
The following step involves invoking the HAND method to determine the corresponding stage from segmented imagery assuming the mode with the lower backscatter as the inundated class.
The third step takes this noisy water surface plane sampled from the segmented image and HAND data and seeks to smooth the surface via a low-pass graph signal filter utilizing the connectivity defined by the NHD Version 2.
In closing, these filtered stages are then remapped to inundation extents via the HAND method.

A graphical representation of this procedure is demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:process_flowchart}.

\subsection{Image Segmentation}
\label{ssec:image_segmentation}

Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR data, captured on October 12, 2016, is used in the interferometric wide mode offering vertical-vertical (VV) and vertical-horizontal (VH) polarizations \cite{copernicus2016sentinel} \footnote{S1A\_IW\_GRDH\_1SDV\_20161012T111514\_20161012T111543\_013456\_01580C\_1783\.SAFE}. 
Due to SAR's bi-modal distribution, the image is initially segmented via Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) which assumes there are two components of data each parameterized as Gaussian densities \cite{reynolds2009gaussian,mclachlan2004finite}.
The GMM parameter set comprised of the mean vector, weight vector, and covariance matrix, are learned with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. 
EM initializes the parameters randomly or with K-means clusters then uses the probability of membership for each data point to each cluster to derive updated parameters \cite{barazandeh2018behavior,dempster1977maximum}. 
Repeating the process until the log-likelihood of the Gaussian Mixtures converges within some finite tolerance effectively maximizing the local likelihood \cite{barazandeh2018behavior,dempster1977maximum}.
